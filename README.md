06/11/22 AM: working on datatables, created some sample user data in excel, converted to different formats using www.convertcsv.com 
Managed to create an interactive table using javascript, all code contained within index.html for now
This is a rudimentary way of displaying the data, with open banking software you would be able to pull in the data directly from the source once the user has granted permission.  

07/11/22 Added a folder with some cute lime svg images (from https://freesvg.org/)

08/11/22 Created CSS file to format the page.  Updated index.html to assist formatting.
